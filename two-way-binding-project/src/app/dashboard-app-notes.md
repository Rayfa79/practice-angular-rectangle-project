## Getting Started
- Go to GitHub and create the name of your app: ________
- copy https from github and CLONE repo to GitHub
- In VS CODE save to:  coding-projects-github>practice-projects>angular-apps FOLDER
- Copy and Paste Max starter files into your project folder
- run npm install (will intall all max's dependencys and modules)
- create new app: ng new ____ (standalone components will automatically be created)
- To use older modules instead: ng new my-app --no-standalone
- create new components: ng g c ____
- if cloning repo: npm install (install modules, and dependencys)
- run server: ng serve
- [ ] Task 2
- [x] Completed task

## Adding New Components
- Header: ng g c header --skip-tests
- Create a Dashboard Folder w/each dashboard item component inside
  - server-status component, tickets component and traffic component
- IMPORT and add EACH component to app.component.ts imports array
- Create a new-ticket component in TICKETS folder (this will be the support tickets form!)
- 

## 104 Creating a ReUsable dashboard-item component & using Content Projection
- server-status, tickets, and traffic component template have REPETIVE CODE
- CREATE a dashboard-item component in DASHBOARD FOLDER
- COPY redundant markup to dashboard item from one component
- To make header img and h2 TEXT DYNAMIC MUST USE property binding w/in selector
  - <div id="dashboard">
    <app-dashboard-item
      [image]="{src: 'status.png', alt: 'a status symbol'}"
      title = "a signal symbol">
      <app-server-status />
    </app-dashboard-item>
- MAKE SURE to IMPORT dashboard-item to app.component
- In dashboard-item.html make sure to ADD <ng-content/> after header to keep
  component specific code in the output
  -<div class="dashboard-item">
  <article>
    <header>
      <img [src]="image.src" [alt]="image.alt" />
      <h2>{{title}}</h2>
    </header>
   <ng-content></ng-content>
  </article>
</div>

## 105: reating a ReUsable button component & using Content Projection

- The new-ticket template and header template have the SAME HTML button element code
- FIX: we will use this code in multiple components
    1. Create a shared folder in app folder
    2. ADD BUTTON component to shared folder
    3. Add the following code to button.html: Leave the button element in components where reusable button is used
       - <span> Logout </span>
         <span class="icon"> arrow icon </span> 
    3. We will EXTEND the builT in button element via attribute selectors
    4. We will not WRAP other components code w/ <app-button >
    5. in button component SELECTOR property add: 
       - selector: 'button[appButton]' (add this attribute selector to extend button)
    6. IMPORT BUTTON COMPONENT w/in each component where it is used!!!!!
    7. In each component template that that uses this reusable button class  add
       - <li> 
           <button appButton></button>
         </li>
## 106 Getting Dynamic Data for reusable button LOGOUT TEXT and aarow icon
- There are two ways to dynamically add this data

- WAY ONE: set from outside via @Input({required: true}) variable!: string / or /variable = input.required<string>() (function way). Set one input for Logout and one for the arrow icon

- WAY TWO: 
   - add <ng-content> placeholders in reusable button component: button.html: 
            <span>
              <ng-conent />
            </span>
            <span class=".icon"> <ng-conent /> </span>

   - How to use more then one <ng-content/> in reusable component to select DIFFERENT pieces of wrapped content and OUTPUT them in diffent places in component templates
         - How do we do this? and where?
           a. In the button.html.   We add a CSS SELECTOR to one of the <ng-content/> by using select = " CSS SELECTOR GOES HERE"
              <span>
                <ng-content/>
            </span>
            <span > 
                <ng-content select=".icon">
            </span>
    - In components where you want to use reusable button (new-ticket and header) component ADD the CSS CLASS SELECTOR .icon WHERE THAT <ng-content/> should be rendered (wrap with span just like in reusable component html)
          <button appButton>
            Logout (this is data that will be rendered)
            <span class="icon"> arrow gif goes here </span>
          </button>


## 108. Multi Element Custom Components & Content Projection
- Use Case: create ANOTHER reusable component for the repetitve markup in the 
  new-ticket components form element markup below. This is used TWICE
  - <p>
      <label>Title</label>
      <input name="title" id="title">
    </p>
  - ng g c shared/control --skip-content
  - Each Component will have different content for the lable and inputs data
  - TWO WAYS TO DYNAMICALLY ADD DATA: using Input, OR <ng-content>we will use BOTH
    1. for label data: USE INPUT FUNCTION and STRING INTERPOLATION
       - label = input.required<string>();
       - <label> {{ label() }} <label>
    2. for INPUT use <ng-content>
       - DYNAMIC INPUTS MAY USE: TEXTAREA, INPUTS, DATE TYPES, DROPDOWNS EXT
       - Use <ng-content> to allow user to enter ANY input type or attribute type
       - To be sort of RESTRICTIVE of the data that allowed use SELECT
         <p>
          <label> {{ label( )}} </label>
          <ng-content select="input, textarea">
        </p>
    3. In new-ticket TEMPLATE now add:
       <form>
        <app-control label="Title">
            <input name="title" id="title">
        </app-control>

        <app-control label="Request">
           <textarea name="request" id="request" rows="3"> </textarea>
        </app-control>
       </form>
         
## 109: Scoping CSS styles to components
- Styles added to component will be SCOPED only to that component!
- Make sure css file is reference in ts files styleUrl
- The styles that are scoped to reusable component will not work. Fix in nect section
- Add all styles to individual components INCLUDING its MEDIA QUERIES

## 110: Understand and configure view encapsulation
- What the hell is view encapsulation?
- USE CASE: THE PROBLEM:  when creating reusable components that use content projection w/ ng-content. The actual dynamic content is in OTHER components so you CANNOT style these components using the reusable
  components css file because it is SCOPED only to THAT component
  Example Component Css File in RESUABLE COMPONENT: control.css
      .control label { display: block}
      .control input, control textrea { color: red;}
   Example: RESUSABLE COMPONENT HTML FILE: control.html markup
       <p class="control">
       <ng-content select="input" />
       </p>
    THE PROBLEM: the control class will NOT WORK ON THE <ng-content /> markup in OTHER components its ONLY SCOPED TO MARKUP THATS REALLY AND NOT PLACEHOLDER MARKUP.
- THE FIX: go to component.ts of the REUSABLE component and add encapsulation: property to its @component decorator object
   THE EXAMPLE:  @Component({
                    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None ........(make sure to IMPORT)
              })
- WHAT DOES THIS DO? disables CSS STYLE SCOPING making them global styles

## 111. Component Host Elements :Using :host selector in reusable components css
- WHAT THE HELLS IS A HOST ELEMENT? every angular component has a host element which is the element that SELECTED BY SELECTOR: exp "app-header" TARGETS <app-header>

- THE PROBLEM: The reusable button component does NOT have the actual button element in its MARKUP. The button element is in the COMPONENTS that will use the reusable button element
               So we CANNOT target the button element in the button components CSS to style it since its not there.

- THE FIX: use the host SELECTOR which allows you to add styles to the HOST ELEMENT which would be the button element rendered in OTHER COMPONENT
- THE FIX #2: in button component ADD button element to markout and in COMPONENTS where reusable button component is used WRAP in app-button component (now btn element will be in reusable component)
- HOW TO USE IT (fix #1): in the button.css to style the button elements we would add :host INSTEAD of using the button selector. :host TARGETS the HOST SELECTOR !!!
    :host {
        display: block;
        color: red;
    }
- QUESTION: Does view encapsulation have to be set to ViewEncasulation.NONE since styles are being added to another component via : NO NOT FOR USING :HOST SELECTOR!!!!!
## 112. Using Host Elements Like Regular Elements
- The Problem: in out CONTROL.HTML resuable component we have the following code
  <p class="control">
    <label> {{ label() }} >
    <ng-content select="input, textarea" />
  </p>
  - In our reusable component CSS we use the control selector to style the label and input
 - But we do NOT wnat to add the control selector to the above <p> but rather in the components that are using the reusable component! REMOVE P ELEMENT THAT WRAPS THE control.html code!
 - We cannot use the :host selector in the CSS because we have viewEnapsulation set to NONE and for some reason this will not work.
 - but WE CAN add the control class to the reusable component element selector in the components where we use this reusable component. 
 - IN NEW-TICKET COMPONENT HTML FILE ADD: 
    - <app-control class="control" label="title">
           code goes here
      <app-control />
      <app-control class="control" lable="request"></app-control>
## 113. REFACTOR ABOVE CODE: Interacting with Host Elements From Inside Components
- Use Case: PROBLE: redundant code: For above video 112 we must MANUALLY add the control class to every <app-control class="control"> to all the host element to style inputs. 
- SOLUTION: In the reusable CONTROL component's ts file add:
        @Component({
            host: {
                class: 'control'
            }
        })
- THIS WILL ADD THE CLASS ATTRIBUTE PROPERTY OF CONTROL TO 'app-control" where ever being used
- TIP: encapsulation DOES NOT have to be set to NONE to use this!!
- In new-ticket component html REMOVE the class="control" form the <app-control>
          <app-control label="Title">
            <input name="title" id="title">
          </app-control>
         <app-control  label="Request">
           <textarea name="request" id="request" rows="3"></textarea>
        </app-control>

## 114. When (NOT) to Rely on Host Elements: Removing Useless Wrapper Elements in Reusable Component that Use Content Projection.
- USE CASE: We Want to get RID of WRAPPERS in the reusable Components because they cause uneccisarry nesting in the DOM. BUT we have CSS classes added to these wrappers that use the reuable compnents styles
            get rid of all wrappers DIVs in the project (components that use resuable compoennts and have content projection). Add :host CSS selectors in reuable component CSS to target projected content in the components
            using it

- TIP: do NOT get rid of wrappers that have SEMANTIC meaning such as <form>, <section> ect but get rid of damn <div>
- SOLUTION #1(don't use): In the reusable components ts file we will add the class to the @dDecorator
              @Component({
            host: {
                class: 'control'
            }
        })
    - PROBLEM: this SHOULD add the class whereever the reusable components app selector is used BUT it will not work due to CSS scoping via VIEW encapsulation
    - SOULTION: In the reusable components ts file add the following property: 
             @Component({
                    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None ........(make sure to IMPORT)
              })
- SOLUTION #2 (a better solution): Use host CSS selector in the reusable component. This will target the host element selector in any component using it. You DO NOT have to add encapsulation: viewEncapsulation.None to
              use it. You do NOT have to do anything on the html templates that use the reusable compoent except use the host wrapper to wrap the content. Make sure that :host selector is used to add
              styles to the projected content in the compoents INSTEAD of adding classes!

## 115. Interacting with Host Elements via @HostListener and @HostBinding
- There are TWO ways to add properties to the HOST ELEMENTS
  - 1. By adding a HOST property setting on the @Decorator object
       of the host element

       @Decorator({
           host: {
            class: 'control',
            '(click)': 'onClick()'
           }
       })
  - 2. WAY TWO: this is an older way and the first way is recommended
       Add @HostBinding and/or @HostListener in the component class

       export class Control Component{

        @HostBinding('class') className = 'control'
        @HostListner('click') onClick(){
          console.log(clicked)
        }
       }

       - the ('class') above is optional and this will be the property name added to the host component @decorator

       - ('click') is NOT optional and is the type of event
## Accessing Host Elements Programatically
- What the hell does this mean? When you want to ACCESS (some info) about the host element within the .ts component page
  - example: why would you want to access it?
- HOW TO ACCESS THE HOST ELEMENT IN THE FILE?
  - 1. via the contructor 
  - 2. OR via the inject function
- THE STEPS: to access the host element
  - 1. if using inject()
       a. import inject
       b. in the class set a variable equal to inject()
          private el = inject(ElementRef);
       c. Make sure to IMPORT ElementRef
       d. To console.log the ElementRef:
          1. add a click event to the host element that calls
             the onClick() method

          2.  @Decorator({
           host: {
            class: 'control',
            '(click)': 'onClick()'
           }
             })

          3. then: 
             onClick() {
              console.log(this.el)
             }
          4. Click the host element and you should see data in the
             console
## 117. Class Binding Repitiion: CONDITIONALLY RENDER CSS CLASSES
- How do you conditionally render ONE class on an element?
  a. You you CLASS BINDING and set equal to a condition
      exp: <div [class.status]="currentStatus === 'online' ">
      - in the component add a property called currentStatus
        and set to online or offline initially.
- 
## 118. Theres More Then One Way of Binding CSS Classes Dynamically
- BINDING MULTIPLY CLASSES DYNAMICALLY
- How? Add [class] to element and set equal to an OBJECT w/multiple
       properties with the key being the class and the value being
       the conditional

- USE CASE: In the server-status component CSS we have multiple css
           class that currently do NOT exist in its template.
           In the template add these class based on a condition.

           TIP: the condition will be the value of a property in its
                component.
- THE EXAMPLE: in the server-status template add
               <div [class]= "{
                     status: true (always add status class),
                     'status-online': currentStatus === 'online',
                     'status-offline': currentStatus === 'offline',
                     'status-unknown': currentStatus === 'unknown'
                  }">
        - Make sure to add the currentStatus property to the component
    
## 119. A Closer Look @ Dynamic Inline CSS Styling
- Dynamically adding Styles to a component/element
- How do you add a SINGLE style to a component dynamically?
    a. <div [style.fontSize]=" 'the computed value' " >
    a. TIP: USE camel case or wrap in single quotes for double words
    b. TIP: must wrap the VALUE in SINGLE QUOTES!!!!!!
- How to add MULTIPLE STYLES to a component dynamically?
    a. <div [style]="{
             fontSize: '64px',
             color: 'pink'
         }">

## 120. Manipulating State & Using Literal Values
- MIMIC A SERVER UPDATING ITS STATUS BY USING SetINTERVAL FUNCTION
- STEPS:
- 1. add a constructor function. Add setInterval function to its BODY
- 2. In interval function run code after 5 sec which is 5000ms
- 3. in setInterval function create variable that returns random
     number between 0-1
- 4. Create a conditional that checks if rnd number is less then 0.5
     if it is set this.currentStatus = 'online'

    currentStatus = 'offline'
    constructor(){
      setInterval(()=> {
        const rnd = Math.random();

        if( rnd < 0.5 ) {
          this.currentStatus = 'online';
        }else if (rnd < 0.9 ){
            this.currentStatus = ' offline';
        }else {
          this.currentStatus = 'unknown';
        }
      }, 5000)
    }
- 5. Set LITERAL TYPES on the currentStatus property this will allow
     only CERTAIN TYPES:
     example: 
     currentStatus: 'offline' | 'online' | 'unknown' = 'offline';
- 6. The server status CSS should now change every 5sec in the template
## 121. Introductin the Component LifeCycle ngOnInit
- WHAT THE HELL IS ngOnInit? all components go through a lifecycle
                   ngOnInit is a lifecyle hook that runs code AFTER
                   ANGULAR has INITIATED ALL INPUTS Read. So
                   input values will be AVAILABLE!
- WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTOR &ngOnInit?
               - The constructor runs everytime a component is 
                 instantiated and ngOnit runs after inputs are read
- WHY SHOULD WE NOT PUT LOGIC IN THE CONSTRUCTOR?
               - best practice to keep LEAN and only use to initalize
                 classes! other logic should go in ngOnInit
## 122. Implementing LifeCycle Interfaces
- WHY SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT LIFECYCLE INTERFACES?
           a. It protects AGAINST TYPO'S! angular
              does NOT show errors when spelling ngonit or
              other lifecycles! So hard to debug
           b. Implement ALL THE HOOKS!!!!! to check for 
              typos
  
- HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT LIFECYCLE INTERFACES?
           a. export class Server implements ngOnInit {
                ngOnInit(){
                  put code here!
                }
           }
           b. Make sure to IMPORT ngOnInit
## 123. Component LifeCylce a DeepDive
- Component LifeCylce Phases:
  1. Phase 1: Creation
           Method: constructor(): runs when angular instantiates
                   component
  2. Phase 2: Change Detection
           Method: ngOnInit: Runs once after angular initialized all 
                   the inputs. RUNS BEFORE COMPONENT TEMPLATE IS
                   INITALIZED. so you can change template ui based
                   on a properties updated state

           Method: ngOnChanges: Runs everytime component inputs 
                   changed
           Method: ngDoCheck: Runs evertime this components
                   checked for changes. 

           Method: ngAfterViewInit: Runs once after the components view
                   is initalized. 

           Method: ngAfterContentInit: Runs once after component 
                   content is initialized. 
           Method: ngAftterViewChecked: Runs everytime the components
                   view has been checked for changes. 

           Method: ngAfterContentChecked: Runs everytime the components
                   content has been checked for changes. 

- Execution Order: During Initialization
  1. Constructor

  Change Detection
  2. ngOnChanges
  3. ngOnInit
  4. ngDoCheck
  Content                          Views
  1. ngAfterContentInit          1. ngAfterViewInit
  2. ngAfterContentChecked       2. ngAfterViewChecked
  Rendering
  1. AfterRender

- Subsequent Updates
  1. ngOnChanges
  2. ngDoCheck
  3. ngAfterContentChecked     3. ngAferViewChecked
  Rendering
  1. AfterRender

- WHY SHOULD YOU ONLY INITIALIZE CLASSES IN THE CONSTRUCTOR?
     - best practices to keep it clean
     - it DOES not have ACCESS to INPUTS values!!!!
- RUN MOST OF THE LOGIC in ngOnInit hook...http calls ect
     - will run after input values are initalized
     - use this for component initialization
- WHEN SHOULD I RUN ngOnChanges?
     - when you want to update a component template based on 
       changes to the component state (input value changes)
     - This hook takes in a property called changes that
       stores data on the inputs current value, previous value
- WHEN SHOULD I RUN ngDoCHECK?
     - this code runs WHENEVER there is a change in a component
     - This code runs ALOT. Do not put code in this hook it will runa lot
      
## 124. Component Cleanup With ngOnDestroy
- WHATS ngOnDestroy?
  a. its hook that runs ONCE before a component is destroyed
- WHY THE HELL DO YOU NEED IT?
  a. it prevents memory leaks which slow down apps. Apps can 
     potentially keep running code in the background if a 
     component is not detroyed
- USE CASE: in video 124 we are running an interval to replicate
            a server with changing status text. We are NOT
            conditionally rendering the  service-status comp
            so its not destroy but it could potentially be
            removed in the future so we most destory it to 
            prevent MEMORY LEAKS: interval will keep running
            in background
- THE STEPS TO USING ngOnDestory
  1. implenment and import onDestroy in the class

  2. save setInverval function in a variable called intrval

  3. Hover over setInterval to see its return type which
     is NodeJs.Timeout

  4. In the class add invterval as a private (cant be accesed in template) property and set return type as NodeJs.TimeOut
  make sure to add a ? which means or UNDEFINDED
       private interval?: NodeJs.Timeout

  5. Create a onDestroy method in the body call:
     onDestroy(){
      clearTimeOut(this.interval)
     }

  6. TIP: if get an error with NodeJs.Timeout return type
         instead add:
       private interval?: ReturnType<typeof setInterval>  
  )
## 125. Component CleanUp With DestroyRef
- ngOnDestroy works in OLDER Angular Versions

- DestroyRef is a newer modern way to clean up components but it
  does not work with older versions of angular. Works with Angular
  16 and newer. 

- HOW DO YOU USE IT IN COMPONENTS?
  1. INJECT DestroyRef via the constructor OR the inject function
          a. private destroyRef = inject (DestroyRef);
  2. IMPORT DestroyRef: import { DestroyRef } from '@angular/core'

  3. Save LOGIC or function in a variable
         a. ngOnInit(){
              const interval = setInterval(()=> {
                 logic goies here
              })
         } 
  4. CALL DestroyRef when component is destroyed and add logic
     to clear the interval from above
         a. add this function AFTER setInverval function but still
            inside of ngOnInit

         b. this.destroyRef.onDestroy(()=> {
               clearInterval(interval)
         })
  5. You can use destroyRef onDestroy more then ONCE in a 
     component. You can use on serveral methods within a component
## 126. Handlong Form Submittion (repetition)

## 127.  Working with Template Variables
- HOW DO YOU EXTRACT THE VALUES FROM INPUTS When a USER INPUTS THEM?
-     a. THERE ARE TWO WAYS: 
         1. [(ngModel)]="add variable"
         2. Store element in template variable (element references)
            < input id="name" name="name" #name>
            - to access input value in the component add to 
              (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(name.value);
            - to console.log the OBJECT use console.dir(name);
            - This needs an event to extract input value (form submit)
          3. via@ViewChild: add a template variable (elementRef) to the
              input or element to get its value
              1. You can use this without an event!!!!
              2. add the elementRef to the element whose data u want
              3. To access the elements data (input ect) in the 
                 component do the following. In the class add: 
                 1. @ViewChild('form') form: 
                 2.
                 3

## 128.  Extracting Input Values Via Template Variables

## 129.  Template Variables and Component Instances

## 130.  Getting Access To Template Elements via  ViewChild
- USE CASE: will you template variables (elementRef) to RESET form
            in new-ticket component once form submitted
- STEPS:
   1. Add template variable to form element
      <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(titleInput.value,form)" #form> </form>
   2. In the components onSubmit method pass in the form and its type
      onSubmit(title: string, form: HTMLFormElement){
            console.log(title)
            form.reset()
         }
         ***TIP: to get the #form type just hover over it in the template
- TO GET FORM INPUT VALUES IN COMPONENT WITHOUT TRIGGERING AN EVENT
  STEPS:
        1. add template variable in form element
        2. YOU DO NOT have to pass form into onSubmit
             <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(titleInput.value)" #form> </form>
        3. In component access form via @ViewChild() form(variable 
           name)

        4. @ViewChild can take in a ELEMENT as a string or
           a component instance such as ButtonComponent

        5. @ViewChild('form') form?: ElementRef<HTMLFormElement>

        6. when using @ViewChild you MUST add ElementRef as a type
           and add EXTRA infromation about the elements type
           if you hover over the #form in the template you will see
           its of type HTMLFormElement

        7. Add a ? after form (form?:) because when the component
           is rendered its VIEW WILL NOT BE RENDERED first and
           the form data will come back undefined!!!

        8. not lets use the form variable to reset the form in the
           onSubmit method
           onSubmit(title: string) {
                 console.log(title)
                 this.form?.nativeElement.reset()
             }
            TIP:..add the question mark to the above which will
                tell typscript to only access the form data and
                reset the form if its NOT UNDEFINED

            TIP: ....add nativeElement to access the HTMLFormElement
                 its is wrapped by an ElementRef so we need the 
                 nativeElement to access it



## HOW TO SELECT MULTIPLE ELEMENTS WHEN USING @ViewChild?
  - use ViewChildren!
  - USE CASE: if you have a ButtonComponent in your template that
    has multiple buttons in which you wanto get and store info
      1. @ViewChildren(ButtonComponent) buttons
        - this will give you an array of elementRef buttons instances!

## 131.  Using the ViewChild Signal Function
- Form Angular 17.3 and above only
- THE SYNTAX:
   export class NewTicketComponent {
      private form = viewChild<ElementRef<> HTMLFormElement> >('form);

      //to reset the form
      onSubmit(title: string){
          this.form()?.nativeElement.reset()
       }
   }

## 132.  ViewChild vs ContentChild
- How can you get hold of PROJECTED CONTENT (<ng-content>) from
  the template in the component?

  example: You want get hold of the input and textArea data in the component

       //control.component TEMPLATE
         <label>{{ label() }}</label>
         <ng-content select="input,textarea"/>

- You CANNOT use @ViewChild or viewChild() form PROJECTED CONTENT

- THE SOLUTION:  use @ContentChild, @ContentChildren or contentChild()

   1. //control.component to get access to the input element data

      @ContentChild('input') private control?: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>

      onClick(){
        console.log(this.control)
      }

   2. ADD #input elementRef to the input ELEMENTS. NOT the 
      <ng-content select="input,textarea"/> in the template
      BUT where the <app-control> is being used!!!

      //new-ticket.compoent TEMPLATE
      <app-control label="Title">
         <input name="title" id="title" #input>
      </app-control>

      <app-control  label="Request">
        <textarea name="request" rows="3" #input></textarea>
      </app-control>

- REFACTOR TO USE contentChild() function with Signal

    private control = contentChild<ElementRef<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>>('input');

    onClick(){
      console.log(this.control())
    }


## 133.  A Closer Look at Decorator based querires & LifeCycle Hooks
- What lifeCycle hook should run @ViewChild, viewChild(), @ContentChild(), ContentChild() in if we want access to an element?
 
   a. ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterContentInit: 
- 
- ngAfterViewInit: Runs ONCE after component's VIEW has been
      initialized
- ngAfterContentInit: Runs ONCE after components CONTENT has been
      initialized.

- afterNextRender: (render phase) Runs ONCE the NEXT TIME that ALL
      components have been rendered to the DOM.
- afterRender: Runs EVERYTIME ALL components have been rendered to the 
      Dom. Will run over and over again

## 134.  The afterRender & afterNextRender LyfeCycle Functions
- afterNextRender: (render phase) Runs ONCE the NEXT TIME that ALL
      components have been rendered to the DOM.
- afterRender: Runs EVERYTIME ALL components have been rendered to the 
      Dom. Will run over and over again
- CANNOT use in older versions of angular <= 16   
- Where do you register these hooks?
    a. In the constructor body
    b. constructor(){
      afterRender(()=> {
        console.log('afterRender')
      })
     }
     c. constructor(){
         afterNextRender(()=> {
            console.log('afterNextRender')
         })
            
         
     }
-  What is a use case for using these hooks?
    

## 135.  Making Sense of Signal Effects
- How to run code logic IN THE COMPONENT when a signal value
  changes?

  1. In the components constructor you must run the following
     constructor(){
      effect(()=> {
        console.log(this.currentStatus())
      })
     }
- TIP: angular AUTOMATICALLY sets up a SUBSCRIPTION for a signal
      property in the TEMPLATE and cleans it up also
      

- in server-status component REFACTOR the currentStatus
  property to use a signal

- currentStatus: 'online' | 'offline' | 'unknown' = 'offline';

- REFACTOR: currentStatus = signal<'online' | 'offline' | 'unknown">('offline')

- REFACTOR: in all place where signal value is updated use SET
  - this.currentStatus.set('online')

- REFACTOR: in template refactor: 
  - currentStatus()=== "online"

## 136.  Signal Effects CleanUp Functions
- When working with Signal effects, you sometimes might need to perform some cleanup work before the effect function runs again (e.g., to clear some timer or something like that).

Angular's effect() allows you to do that!

It does provide you with an onCleanup hook which you can execute as part of your effect function to define what should happen before the effect code runs the next time:

effect((onCleanup) => {
  const tasks = getTasks();
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`Current number of tasks: ${tasks().length}`);
  }, 1000);
  onCleanup(() => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  });
});
## 137.  TypeScript and Type Models Repetition
- GOAL: take submited ticket values from new-ticket component
        form to create a new ticket and eventually show these tickets

- USE CASE : we can create a ticket service to save tickets and output 
         them or we can create a property in the new-ticket component
         that OUTPUTS ticket values to the TICKET COMPONENT

- STEPS: 
       1. in TICKET COMPONENT: create a ticket property
          tickets: Ticket[];
       2. Create a ticket.model.ts to describe shape of ticket 
          export interface Ticket {
              id: string;
              title: string;
              request: string;
              status: 'open' | 'closed'
          }
        3. in NEW-TICKET COMPONENT:  OUTPUT form values whenever
           a user creates a new-ticket and clicks submit

           - @Output() add = new EventEmitter<title: string, text:string>()
           - NEW WAY: add = output<title: string, text: string>()

        4. in NEW-TICKET COMPONENT's onSubmit method
            onSubmit(title: string, ticketText: string){
              this.add.emit({title: title, text: ticketText});
            }

## 138.  Component Outputs Repetition
- STEPS CONTINUTED FROM ABOVE
        5. In TICKET COMPONENT TEMPLATE: bind (add) to a method in the
           ticket component
           <div id="new-ticket">
             <app-new-ticket (add)="onAdd($event)">
           </div>
        6. in TICKET COMPONENT: create onAdd method. use data
           to create a ticket using the TICKET interface to shape
           data.

            onAdd(ticketData: {title: string, text: string}){
              const ticket: Ticket = {
                title: ticketData.title,
                text: ticketData.text,
                id: Math.floor(Math.random()+1).toStrig(),
                status: 'open'
              }
              this.tickets.push(ticket);
            }
        

## 139.  A Closer Look @ Template For Loops: Outputting TICKET
 component template into the TICKETS component

- OUTPUT TICKET DATA in TICKETS COMPONENT

- USE MODERN LOOP SYNTAX ONLY FOR ANGULAR 17 or greater!

- STEPS

  1.  In TICKETS COMPONENT add:
      <div>
        <ul>
        @for (ticket of tickets; track ticket.id){
         <li>
        }@empty{
          <p>no tickets available</p>
        }
           <app-ticket />
         </li>
        </ul>

## 140.  Revisiting Inputs and Signals: styling the ticket component
    that we are outputting in the tickets component
- STEPS
- 1. copy and past ticket component html file and css file from max  
     files  
- 2. in TICKET COMPONENT: Use @Input or input() to get new-ticket input
     data from the TICKETS COMPONENT

     @Input({required}) data: Ticket;
           or
     data = input.required<Ticket>();
- 3. In TICKET COMPONENT HTML: add:
     <button>
        <span class="text">{{data().title}}</spam>
             and further down in file add

      @if(true){
        <p>{{data().request}} </p>
        @if(data.request === 'open'){
          <p><button>Mark as completed</p> </button>
        }
      }

 - 3. In TICKETS COMP0NENT HTML file BIND the DATA property in the
      TICKET component to the TICKET from the loop (comes
       from Tickets property)

    <ul>
      @for(ticket of tickets; track ticket.id){
        <li>
          <app-ticket [data]="ticket" />
        </li>
      }

## 141.  Updating Signal Values: Making TICKET btn collapsable
- GOAL: IN TICKET COMPONENT HTML make the following collapsable
        
     <button>
        <span class="text">{{data().title}}</spam>
      </button>
- STEPS
  1. In TICKET COMPONENT create SIGNAL boolean property 
     detailsVisible = signal(false);

  2. IN TICKET COMPONENT HTML: add a click event on the button
     button (click)="onToggleDetails()">
        <span class="text">{{data().title}}</spam>
             and further down in file add

  3. In TICKET COMPONENT: create onToggleDetails method
      onToggleDetails(){
        this.detailsVisible().set(!this.detailsVisible)
      }

  4. In TICKET COMPONENT HTML: change @if, @else statments

     @if(detailsVisible === 'true') or (detailsVisible()) means same
     <svg........>

     @if(detailsVisible()){
      <p>{{data().request}}</p>
     }


     
        

## 142.  Cross Component Communication & State Mangagement-
- GOAL: in ticket component ui REMOVE MARK AS COMPLETE BUTTON &
        Change cirular icon color next to the test button
        when the ticket is complete

- STEPS:
1.   change STATUS of ticket in TICKETS COMPONENT where tickets
     array is. create onCLOSE method that will close ticket

     onClose(id: string){
       // 1. create a new tickets array

       // 2. interate (map) through each ticket element by running 
             a function for EACH element seeing if the ticket.id
             matches the id from the parameter if it does then
             that ticket should be marked as CLOSE
        
       //3. map that ticket to a NEW OBJECT use spread operator
            to extract all existing properties. OVERWRITE status
            property by setting to 'close'

      //4. return ticket;...if not ticket matching id is found
        
       1. this.tickets = this.tickets.map((ticket)=> {
           2. if(ticket.id === id){
              3. return { ...ticket, status: 'closed'}
           }
           4. return ticket;
       })
     }

2. TRIGGER onCloseTicket() with a custom event in TICKET COMPONENT

   1. in TICKETS COMPONENT create a custom event close property
   close = output()

3. EMIT CLOSE event whenever "mark as complete button" clicked

    1. In TICKET COMPONENT create onMarkComplete method. and emit
       close event. WILL NOT EMIT ANY DATA!

       onMarkComplete(){
          this.close.emit()
       }

4. Create CLICK EVENT in TICKET COMPONENT HTML
     <p><button (click)="onMarkComplete()"> Mark as Completed </p></button>

5. In TICKETS COMPONENT HTML on the <app-ticket> listen for
   the CLOSE EVENT and trigger the onCloseTicket method
   make sure to pass in the ticket.id

   <ul>
      @for(ticket of tickets; track ticket.id){
        <li>
          <app-ticket [data]="ticket" (close)="onCloseTicket(ticket.id)"/>
        </li>
      }

  6. In TICKET COMPONENT HTML REFLECT the ticket completed status

     UPDATE THE BELOW CODE 
     <article>
      <h3>
       <div 
        [class]="{
          'ticket-open': true,
          'ticket-closed': false
        }">

        TO:
        <article>
      <h3>
       <div 
        [class]="{
          'ticket-open': data().status === 'open',
          'ticket-closed': data().status === 'closed'
        }">




## 143.  Comfiguring Component OutPuts and Inputs
- Max goes over adding an alias options object to @input,
  input(), @output()
## 144.  Two-Way Binding Repetition
- Max refactors the code in the NEW_TICKET COMPONENT TEMPLATE
  to use two-way binding instead of template variables

- TIP: remember you can set up the property that the template
       variable will save its input value to as a SIGNAL
       or NON SIGNAL

- Refactored Code:
  1. <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">...do not pass anything inside

  2. IMPORT formsModule to NEW-TICKET COMPONENT
     { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'
     imports: [FormsModule]

  3. add properties to NEW-TICKET COMPONENT
     enteredTitle = '';
     entertedText = '';

  4. Add enteredTitle and enteredText to the form input
     <input name="title" id="title" [(ngModel)]="enteredTitle">
     <input name="text" id="text" [(ngModel)]="enteredText">

  5. In NEW-TICKET COMPONENT create an @Output EventEmitter
     that will pass the input values to the tickets component

     @Output() add = new EventEmitter<{ title: string, text: string}>();

  6. In the onSubmit method emit the add event passing in the
     title and text values from the inputs

     onSubmit(){
    this.add.emit({title: this.enteredTitle, text: this.enteredText})
  }

  7. Reset the form input fields when the form is submitted
     
     onSubmit(){
    this.add.emit({title: this.enteredTitle, text: this.enteredText})
    this.enteredText = '';
    this.enteredTitle = '';
  }

## 145.  Setting Up Custom Two-Way Binding

## 146.  An Easier Way of setting up Custom Two-Way Binding
